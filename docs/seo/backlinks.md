# Backlinks Playbook

Goal: Acquire high-quality, relevant links that help indexing, authority, and qualified traffic for bebitterbebetter.com.br.

## Targets
- Home: https://bebitterbebetter.com.br/
- Now: https://bebitterbebetter.com.br/now

## Priority Profiles & Directories (owned)
1. GitHub
   - Profile README: add links to Home and Now
   - Pin relevant repos with descriptions linking back
2. LinkedIn
   - Website field + About section with a link
3. Linktree or About.me (optional)
   - Aggregate social links + portfolio
4. Dev.to or Medium
   - Publish an intro article with a natural link to Home and a callout to the Now page

## Community & Launchpads (earned)
- Indie Hackers: profile + a post about portfolio rebuild and technical choices
- Hashnode/Dev.to: cross-post technical articles (canonical set to portfolio if applicable)
- Product Hunt: if launching a specific tool/project (not the portfolio itself)

## Anchor Text Guidance
- Branded: "BeBitter", "BeBitter portfolio"
- Branded + name: "Bernardo Gomes portfolio"
- Partial-match (use sparingly, natural): "software engineer portfolio", "developer portfolio"
- Navigational: "what I’m doing now", "Now page"

Avoid over-optimizing anchors. Keep context natural and reader-first.

## Outreach Checklist (10 warm contacts/communities)
- Make a list of 10 peers or communities where your work is relevant
- Craft a short personalized message; ask for feedback; include a single link
- Follow up once after 7–10 days if no response

## Tracking
- Use UTM tags for specific campaigns (e.g., utm_source=github&utm_medium=profile&utm_campaign=portfolio)
- Monitor:
  - Google Search Console > Links (Top linking sites)
  - GA4 > Acquisition > Traffic acquisition (referrals)

## Quality Guardrails
- Relevance > quantity
- Avoid link farms or paid low-quality directories
- Keep page content excellent; links should feel inevitable and helpful
